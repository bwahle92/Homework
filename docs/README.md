# Benjamen Wahle

### I am a former musician turned into former operations manager turning into a current software developer.

## Savvy Coders FS goals:
- ### Complete 12 weeks with the skills, desire and "know-how" to create useful software.
- ### Network with peers and learn opportunities to use developed skills to jumpstart a career.
- ### Leave the cohort with knowledge of future project ideas and paths to take alongside in my new-found career.
